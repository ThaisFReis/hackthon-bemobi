# Research: AI Churn Prevention POC

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework
**Decision**: React 18 with TypeScript 5.x
**Rationale**:
- Mature ecosystem with excellent TypeScript support
- Component-based architecture ideal for admin dashboard and chat interface
- Rich ecosystem for real-time chat functionality
- Strong developer tooling for rapid POC development

**Alternatives considered**: Vue.js, Angular
- Vue.js: Simpler learning curve but smaller ecosystem for chat components
- Angular: More opinionated framework with steeper learning curve for POC timeline

### Backend Framework
**Decision**: Node.js 18+ with Express.js
**Rationale**:
- JavaScript/TypeScript consistency across frontend and backend
- Excellent Stripe SDK support
- Lightweight and fast for POC requirements
- Easy WebSocket integration for real-time chat

**Alternatives considered**: Python Flask, FastAPI
- Python: Would require different language expertise, slower for POC timeline
- FastAPI: Good for APIs but Node.js better for full-stack TypeScript consistency

### Styling Framework
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS
**Rationale**:
- Rapid prototyping capabilities ideal for POC timeline
- Utility-first approach reduces custom CSS overhead
- Excellent React component integration
- Professional appearance with minimal effort

**Alternatives considered**: Bootstrap, Material-UI
- Bootstrap: Less modern approach, more custom CSS required
- Material-UI: More opinionated design system, potentially slower development

### Payment Processing
**Decision**: Stripe API with test mode
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for real API integration (not mocked)
- Excellent documentation and developer experience
- Comprehensive test mode for safe POC development
- Industry standard with reliable TypeScript SDK

**Alternatives considered**: PayPal, Square
- PayPal: More complex integration, less developer-friendly for POC
- Square: Good option but Stripe has better documentation and test tooling

### AI Integration Approach
**Decision**: Simple prompt templates with language model API
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for dynamic conversation generation
- Simpler than complex conversation management systems
- Easier to control conversation flow for demo reliability
- Cost-effective for POC scope

**Alternatives considered**: Complex conversation frameworks, rule-based systems
- Complex frameworks: Overkill for POC scope, longer development time
- Rule-based: Wouldn't meet constitutional requirement for natural conversation

### Data Storage
**Decision**: Local JSON files for mock customer data
**Rationale**:
- No database setup overhead for POC timeline
- Easy to populate with realistic demo data
- Simple to modify for different demo scenarios
- Meets constitutional requirement for realistic mock data

**Alternatives considered**: SQLite, PostgreSQL
- SQLite: Additional setup overhead without benefit for POC scope
- PostgreSQL: Overkill for POC with limited data requirements

### Real-time Communication
**Decision**: WebSocket integration for chat interface
**Rationale**:
- Required for natural chat conversation flow
- Express.js has good WebSocket support via Socket.io
- Essential for real-time payment processing feedback
- Enhances demo experience with immediate responses

**Alternatives considered**: Server-sent events, polling
- SSE: Unidirectional, wouldn't support full chat functionality
- Polling: Poor user experience, not suitable for natural conversation

## Development Approach

### Project Structure Strategy
**Decision**: Separate backend/frontend directories with shared TypeScript types
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns for POC development
- Allows parallel development of different components
- Easy to deploy as single-page application
- Maintains code organization for demo walkthrough

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Minimal testing focused on critical payment flows
**Rationale**:
- POC timeline constraints require focus on core functionality
- Payment processing must be thoroughly tested for demo reliability
- Constitutional principle: functional core over polish includes testing priorities
- Integration tests for complete user flows more valuable than unit test coverage

### Deployment Strategy
**Decision**: Local development setup optimized for hackathon demonstration
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for reliable demo on presenter's machine
- No deployment complexity during POC phase
- Easy to run and demonstrate without external dependencies
- Faster iteration during development

## Risk Mitigation

### Payment API Reliability
- Implement fallback responses for network issues (constitutional requirement)
- Use Stripe test mode with known working test cards
- Pre-test all payment scenarios before demo

### AI Response Consistency
- Use template-based prompts to ensure predictable conversation flow
- Test conversation paths with different customer scenarios
- Implement fallback responses for unexpected AI responses

### Demo Reliability
- Local JSON data eliminates external data dependencies
- WebSocket connections with reconnection logic
- Tested conversation flows for consistent demo experience

## Constitutional Compliance Verification

✅ **Working Payment Integration**: Stripe API with real test transactions
✅ **Natural Conversation Flow**: Language model integration with dynamic responses
✅ **Demonstrable Churn Prevention**: Realistic mock data with measurable outcomes
✅ **Functional Core Over Polish**: Technology choices prioritize working features
✅ **5-Minute Demo Constraint**: All decisions optimize for demo reliability and timing
