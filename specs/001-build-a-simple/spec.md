# Feature Specification: AI Churn Prevention POC

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-simple`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a simple POC demonstrating an AI agent that prevents customer churn through proactive chat conversations with payment resolution. The system has two components: an admin panel showing mock customers at risk (expiring cards, failed payments) with trigger buttons, and a chat interface where the AI automatically initiates conversations when triggered. During chat, the AI naturally guides customers to update payment methods, processes new payment information in real-time using Stripe test mode, and completes the interaction with confirmation. Demo flow: admin selects at-risk customer, clicks trigger, chat opens with AI starting conversation, customer provides new payment details, system processes payment and shows success. Target outcome: demonstrate complete churn prevention cycle from risk identification to payment resolution in under 3 minutes per customer interaction."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An admin identifies customers at risk of churning due to payment issues (expired cards, failed payments) and triggers proactive AI-driven conversations to resolve these issues. The AI agent engages customers in natural conversation, guides them through payment method updates, processes the new payment information securely, and confirms successful resolution - all within a streamlined 3-minute interaction that prevents customer loss.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an admin viewing the dashboard with at-risk customers, **When** they click "Trigger Chat" for a customer with an expired card, **Then** a chat window opens with the AI initiating a natural conversation about payment method updates
2. **Given** a customer in active chat with the AI agent, **When** they provide new payment card details, **Then** the system processes the payment in Stripe test mode and displays real-time confirmation
3. **Given** a successful payment update, **When** the interaction completes, **Then** the customer status updates to "Resolved" and the admin can see the outcome metrics
4. **Given** an admin reviewing completed interactions, **When** they view the results dashboard, **Then** they can see measurable churn prevention metrics and success rates

### Edge Cases
- **What happens when a customer provides invalid payment information during chat?**: When a customer provides invalid card details, the system validates input in real-time and the AI responds with natural guidance ("The card number seems incorrect. Could you double-check those digits?") to help correct the error without frustration
- **How does the system handle Stripe API failures or network connectivity issues during payment processing**: Network or API connectivity issues trigger graceful error handling where the AI acknowledges the technical problem and offers alternative resolution timing ("We're experiencing a brief technical issue. Can I schedule a callback in one hour to complete this?")
- **What occurs if a customer abandons the chat conversation midway through payment update?**: If a customer becomes inactive for more than 2 minutes during payment collection, the AI sends a gentle check-in message, and if the conversation is completely abandoned, the system marks the customer for follow-up outreach within 24 hours
- **How does the AI respond to customers who are hesitant or refuse to update payment information?**: When customers express reluctance or refuse to update payment information, the AI acknowledges their concerns with empathy, provides security reassurances, offers alternative timing, and ultimately respects their decision without applying pressure while explaining potential service impacts

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a list of at-risk customers with two specific payment issues (expiring cards and failed payments) in a standalone admin dashboard page
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow admins to trigger proactive chat conversations for specific at-risk customers via button clicks
- **FR-003**: AI agent MUST automatically initiate natural, conversational interactions when triggered by admin
- **FR-004**: AI agent MUST guide customers through payment method updates using structured prompt templates with OpenAI API integration for natural, contextual responses within hackathon timeline constraints
- **FR-005**: System MUST securely collect new payment card information through the chat interface
- **FR-006**: System MUST process payment updates in real-time using full Stripe API integration with actual test transactions
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide immediate confirmation of successful payment processing to both customer and admin
- **FR-008**: System MUST update customer status from "at-risk" to "resolved" upon successful payment update
- **FR-009**: System MUST complete the entire churn prevention cycle (trigger to resolution) within 3 minutes per customer interaction
- **FR-009a**: System MUST instrument conversation timing from chat initiation to payment completion with visible countdown timer and automatic session timeout warnings at 2.5 minutes
- **FR-010**: System MUST display measurable outcomes and success metrics for churn prevention efforts
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle payment processing failures gracefully with clear error messages and alternative resolution paths
- **FR-012**: AI conversations MUST feel natural and human-like, avoiding robotic or form-based interactions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Customer**: Represents users at risk of churning, including current payment status, account details, and interaction history
- **Payment Method**: Credit card information including expiration dates, status (active/expired/failed), and transaction history
- **Chat Session**: Individual conversation instances between AI agent and customer, including message history (persisted during demo session only) and outcome status
- **Admin User**: System operators who monitor at-risk customers and trigger proactive interventions
- **Churn Prevention Metrics**: Success rates, completion times, resolution outcomes, and business impact measurements
